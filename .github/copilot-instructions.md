Please review README.md and other .md files of the root folder of the project for more references.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Framework**: Rust
- **Database**: none

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use Rust for all code
- Follow Rust conventions for server/client component separation
- Ensure consistent use of Rust features and idioms
- Search in Google (Serper) if it is necessary for more information about general concepts.
- Check with Context7 the documentation for any specific guidelines.
- Ask for help if you are stuck.
- Use Serena tools for search symbols, edit code or refactor.
- Use Remembrances tools always at the beginning of a task for searching any useful information and at the end for summarizing what you have learned.
- Saves into knowledge base or memories all relevant information about the project changes of interest for the future tasks.
- If you have a complex task, break it down into smaller steps, use Sequential thinking and steps list for the process
- Fetch any relevant information from urls of the context task for updated context
- If you need build or running tests use Terminal.
- Always add tests for any new functionality.



### Testing

- Run `xc check` for linting and type checking and launching tests
  



### Deployment

- Run `xc build` for building the project and review the output for any errors.
  

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Type Errors**: Check readonly props and proper Rust types

### Debug Tips

- Check terminal errors running tests or build
